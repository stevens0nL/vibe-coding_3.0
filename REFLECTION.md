 **The AI as Collaborator**:
  - AI transformed Python script into web app, handling porting and refinements like menu hiding and previews.
  - Accelerated development by 50%, but required precise prompts for accuracy.
  - Highlighted need for human oversight in usability and edge cases.

- **The Framework Experiment**:
  - Shifted from vanilla JS to Vue.js for reactivity and modularity.
  - Used directives like `v-if`, `v-for`, and `v-model` to simplify UI and data handling.
  - Improved maintainability and performance; validated AI's recommendation for small projects.

- **The “Vibe Coding Ceiling”**:
  - AI excelled at functional code but struggled with nuanced UX and edge cases (e.g., question display).
  - Maintained clean, educational style but lacked creative intuition.
  - Emphasized blending AI efficiency with human creativity for better results.

- **Growth Moment**:
  - Bridged Python to web dev, learning reactive frameworks and prompt engineering.
  - Built confidence in prototyping and debugging through AI collaboration.
  - Motivated exploration of more tools, viewing coding as collaborative and evolving.
