# vibe-coding_3.0
This assignment teaches you to work with AI to build something functional quickly, while also learning when AI helps and when it struggles. The goal isnâ€™t to produce perfect code. The goal is to understand how AI collaboration works, where it helps, and where it struggles. Your honest reflection is worth more than a polished app.
