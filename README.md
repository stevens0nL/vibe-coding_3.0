# vibe-coding_3.0
This assignment teaches you to work with AI to build something functional quickly, while also learning when AI helps and when it struggles. The goal isn’t to produce perfect code. The goal is to understand how AI collaboration works, where it helps, and where it struggles. Your honest reflection is worth more than a polished app.
